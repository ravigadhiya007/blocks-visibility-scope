Provide responsive visibility control to all WordPress blocks. Easily hide or show blocks on specific screen sizes (Extra Small to XXL).

== Description ==

Block Visibility Scope gives you **full responsive control over any WordPress block**.
You can decide where each block should be visible: small phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, or wide screens. 

**How to use this plugin:**
1. Edit any page/post with the Gutenberg block editor.
2. Select a block, then in the right-hand **Block Inspector**, locate the **Visibility Control** panel.
3. Toggle the switches to choose where the block should be hidden or visible across different screen sizes.

**Features:**
1. Hide or show blocks based on screen size:
  - Extra Small (<576px – small phones)  
  - Small (576–767px – large phones)  
  - Medium (768–991px – tablets)  
  - Large (992–1199px – laptops)  
  - Extra Large (1200–1399px – desktops)  
  - XXL (≥1400px – wide screens)  
2. Works with **all WordPress blocks**.  
3. Live preview: blocks with visibility rules are highlighted in the editor for easy identification.  
4. Lightweight – minimal code, no heavy dependencies.

This is the simplest way to add responsive block visibility in WordPress without writing a single line of code.
